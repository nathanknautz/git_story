this is a song
all about how
my world got flipped
turned around 
its gonna take a minute, just sit right there
ill tell you a story how i became the prince of bel-air

i was playing basketball and then some people beat me up
my mom got scared so she said im moving to my uncle and auntie 

i took a cab and when it got near i said goodbye to the driver
walked up to the house and thats how i became the prince of bel air
